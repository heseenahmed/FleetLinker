                                       regulatory guidelines.

(8) there is 2 type of kyc policy:
    1- Primary Individual Policy (Individual Primary):  
        Used to verify primary users (e.g., parents or main account holders).  
        This policy applies to adults or main account holders.  
    2- Secondary Individual Policy (Individual Secondary):  
        Used to verify dependent users (e.g., children or secondary users).  
        This policy applies to users who are linked to a primary account.  

(9) Scenario in 2 type of Kyc policy :
              A bank offers virtual cards for families. The parent (primary user) and children (secondary users) 
              are provided cards:
               The parent undergoes the Primary KYC process to verify their identity as the main account holder.
               Each child undergoes the Secondary KYC process, which is linked to the parent’s account.
               This ensures that both the primary and dependent users are verified according to their roles 
               and relationships in the account structure.
